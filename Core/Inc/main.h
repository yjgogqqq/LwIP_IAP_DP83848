   IMPORTANT NOTE:
   ==============
   Be sure that USER_FLASH_FIRST_PAGE_ADDRESS do not overlap with IAP code.
   For example, with all option enabled the total readonly memory size using SW4STM32
   IDE v2.1.0, with optimization for size, is 59784 bytes.
   Based on this result four sectors of 16 Kbytes and a sector of 64 Kbytes will be used to store
   the IAP code, so the user Flash address will start from Sector5.

   In this application the define USER_FLASH_FIRST_PAGE_ADDRESS is set to 128K boundary,
   but it can be changed to any other address outside the 1st 128 Kbytes of the Flash.
